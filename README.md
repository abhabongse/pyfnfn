# Python Function Filename Wrapper

Python Function Filename Wrapper (or `pyfnfn` for short) is a small `python`
decorator snippet which extends any `python` functions to accept **file names**
as arguments in addition to **file-like objects**. This is a work in progress
and should support `python3.3` and newer. For the legacy version (including
support for `python2.7` and `python3.2`), please see [legacy/](legacy/).
